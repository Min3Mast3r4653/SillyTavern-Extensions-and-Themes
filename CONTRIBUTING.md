# Contribution Guidelines
> [!NOTE]
> Much like the contribution guidelines of SillyTavern itself, the standards for this are VERY low.<br>Personally considering adding a "about" or "details" page for each because some extensions don't have very good descriptions or explanations on what they actually do. - Would accept commits if anybody wants to do this.
